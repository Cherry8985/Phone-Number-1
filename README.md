We used the re module in this example, which supports regular expressions in Python.
Furthermore, if the first parameter is not found in the second parameter, the re.search() method returns False.
This method is better for verifying a regular expression than it is for extracting data.
The validity of  numericals, and special characters was checked using the re.search() method.
